AGENT_INSTRUCTION_START
!!! CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTION !!!
This folder )(/Users/syrianhammer/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/1 Projects/RapCap/docs) is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (SSOT) for the project.
Before making any significant code changes or starting a new feature:
1.  **READ** the relevant specs in `product_specs/`.
2.  **UPDATE** the specs if the plan changes (Truthseeking).
3.  **NEVER** skip updating the docs. Code follows Docs, not the other way around.
