# Navigation Structure

## Bottom Navigation (Main Tabs)

The application uses a persistent bottom navigation bar with the following 5 tabs, reflecting the core "Freestyle Architect" workflow:

1.  **Studio** (`/studio`) - *[Icon: Layers]*
    *   The creative hub for multitrack recording and advanced arranging.
2.  **Write Verse** (`/write`) - *[Icon: PenLine]*
    *   Dedicated text editor for writing verses with rhyme assistance.
3.  **Record** (`/record`) - *[Icon: Mic2]* (Center Action)
    *   Quick capture entry point. 
    *   Sub-modes: **Freestyle** (Beat + Audio) and **Thoughts** (Hybrid Audio/Text, no beat).
    *   *Note: "Training" mode has been removed.*
4.  **Rhymes** (`/rhymes`) - *[Icon: BookOpen]*
    *   Rhyme dictionary and linguistic tools.
5.  **Library** (`/library`) - *[Icon: Library]*
    *   Central repository for all created content (Freestyles, Verses, Thoughts).

## Home Screen
The home screen (`/`) has been simplified to focus on **Recent Sessions**, removing "Drills", "Weekly Goals", and redundant CTA sections. It serves as a personal dashboard rather than a feature launcher.
