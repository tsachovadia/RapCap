# Rap Writing Techniques & Flow — Research Notes

## Rhyme Types (Weakest to Strongest)

| Type | Description | Example | Impression |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Perfect (single) | Last vowel+consonant match | cat / hat | Basic |
| Slant / Near | Vowels OR consonants match | time / mind | Essential for rap |
| Assonance | Vowels only match | lake / fate / paid | Engine of most rap rhymes |
| Consonance | Consonants match | strut / street / sit | Used with assonance |
| Multi-syllabic (2) | 2 syllables match | table / cable | Competent |
| Multi-syllabic (3) | 3 syllables match | beautiful / dutiful | Skilled |
| Multi-syllabic (4+) | 4+ syllables match | abominable / phenomenal | Advanced/Elite |
| Compound | Multi-word = single word | astronaut / blast her off | Elite |
| Chain | Same sound across 8+ bars | Extended runs | Virtuoso |

## Key Insight: Slant Rhyme > Perfect Rhyme in Rap
Perfect rhymes alone = amateur. Slant rhymes (vowel matching with different consonants) are the foundation of professional rap. Eminem makes "orange" rhyme with "door hinge / four inch / porridge" through vowel manipulation.

## Flow — Technical Definition

Flow = rhythmic relationship between syllables and the beat grid.

Components:
1. **Syllable placement** relative to kick/snare/hi-hat
2. **Note durations**: 8th notes (standard), 16th notes (double time), triplets (trap)
3. **Accent patterns**: which syllables get stress
4. **Breath placement**: creates phrases
5. **Melodic contour**: pitch rises and falls

### Beat Grid in 4/4 Time
- **Quarter notes** (4/bar) — the main beats (1-2-3-4)
- **Eighth notes** (8/bar) — standard rap syllable grid
- **Sixteenth notes** (16/bar) — double time / fast flow
- **Triplets** (12/bar) — Migos-style / trap flow

### "Pocket"
The sweet spot where rapper's syllable timing locks into the beat's groove. Not mechanically on-grid, but riding the groove with the same push/pull as the drums.

### Flow vs Cadence
- **Flow** = overall rhythmic pattern (macro) — stable within a verse section
- **Cadence** = specific rhythmic/melodic pattern in a phrase (micro)
- Same flow, varying cadence = keeping things fresh
- Complete flow switch = dramatic effect (Kendrick slow→fast)

## J. Cole Freestyle Breakdown (Knox Hill Analysis)

### Simultaneous Schemes (ABAB)
```
"REST asSURED the BEST is in the FLESH and that's for SURE
 the REST of my VESSEL SET for WAR / press RECORD"

Scheme A (positions 1,3): rest / best / flesh / rest / set
Scheme B (positions 2,4): assured / for sure / for war / record
```
Two 3-syllable schemes running in parallel on different beat positions.

### Scheme Signaling
Instead of ending a line on the rhyme, start the NEXT line with it:
```
"...I'm NEW TO IT
My new crib got the Times Square VIEW TO IT
My two chicks lay in my bed I'm USED TO IT"
```
"New to it" at the START of line 2 signals: "this is the new scheme." The scheme then continues at line ends.

### Syllable Count Patterns (6+4)
```
"walking contra-DICTION" (6 syl) / "my de-SCRIPTION" (4 syl)
"off the top ma-GICIAN" (6 syl) / "compo-SITIONS" (4 syl)
```
Specific syllable count structure: 6 syllables of content + 4 syllables of rhyme.

### Key Technical Observations
1. Carrying schemes across 8+ bars while maintaining punchlines/wordplay
2. Multiple rhyme schemes running simultaneously at different positions
3. Starting new schemes where old ones end (scheme transition)
4. Breaking words to span scheme boundaries
5. Varying flow speed while maintaining scheme (slow→fast on same rhyme pattern)
6. Double/triple meanings ("treble" = trouble = high-frequency = high-end)

## How Rappers Build Rhyme Vocabulary

1. **Rhyme list practice**: Given a word, write 30+ rhymes in 2 minutes
2. **Vowel hunting**: Pick a vowel, write 20 words containing it, write 4 bars using them
3. **Phonetic thinking**: "government" → "GUV-ern-ment" → vowel pattern "UH-er-ent" → connects to "punishment", "suffering", "wonderful"
4. **Multi-word phrase banking**: "metaphor" / "let her go" / "better for" share the same vowel pattern
5. **Writing daily**: Building a reservoir of unused bars

## Freestyle: Practiced vs Improvised

| Level | Pre-written | Real-time |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Beginner | ~90% | ~10% |
| Intermediate | ~50% | ~50% |
| Expert | ~20% | ~80% |

### Freestyle Cognitive Process
1. Start with memorized opening (4-8 sec of flow while brain catches up)
2. Scan environment for prompts
3. Pick a rhyme cluster (vowel family) for 2-4 bars
4. Ride the cluster using filler patterns between rhyme words
5. Pivot when cluster runs dry ("but hold up...")
6. Emergency exits: pre-written bars, vocal fillers, repetition

### Word Association = Core Mechanism
Two simultaneous paths:
- **Phonetic**: "fight" → night, right, light, might (rhyme path)
- **Semantic**: "fight" → battle, war, fists, ring (meaning path)
- **Intersection**: "I fight through the NIGHT when it gets dark" (satisfies both)

## Existing Tools (Market Gap)

| Tool | What | Limitation |
|------|------|-----------|
| RhymeZone | Single-word rhyme lookup | No multi-syllabic phrases, no flow |
| RapPad | Writing pad + basic syllable count | Shallow phonetic analysis |
| Genius.com | Manual community annotations | No automation |
| DeepBeat | ML lyric generation (2015) | Outdated |
| LLMs (ChatGPT/Claude) | Generate lyrics | Can't do beat-sync, tend toward "safe" rhymes |

**SIGNIFICANT GAP**: No existing tool does real phonetic analysis + rhyme scheme visualization + flow/beat integration. RapCap is filling this gap.

## Rhyme Scheme in Rap Context

Beyond literary AABB/ABAB:
- **Internal scheme**: Rhymes within a single line
- **Cross-bar scheme**: Bar 1's 3rd word rhymes with Bar 3's 5th word
- **Scheme web**: Multiple overlapping schemes creating a network

## Teaching Progression
1. Counting bars and beats (16 bars, 4/4)
2. End rhyme (AABB couplets)
3. Expanding rhyme vocabulary
4. Internal rhyme
5. Flow exercises (on beat, pocket, variation)
6. Wordplay (double meaning, homophone)
7. Complex schemes (ABAB, AAAA, free-form)
8. Narrative/concept (story across 16 bars)
9. Performance (delivery, breath, emphasis)
